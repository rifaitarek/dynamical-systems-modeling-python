## Introduction

Dynamical systems are mathematical models used to describe the time-dependent behavior of a system's state. This repository provides implementations of various dynamical systems using Python, including both linear and nonlinear models, with applications in physics, biology, and other fields.

## Models Included

1. **Linear Systems**
   - Harmonic Oscillator
   - Damped Oscillator

2. **Nonlinear Systems**
   - Lorenz System
   - Van der Pol Oscillator

3. **Population Dynamics**

   - Logistic Growth Model

4. **Epidemiological Models**
   - SIR Model (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)
   - SEIR Model (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered)
